#+TITLE: New emacs Configuration

The biggest change is that I now use el-get and elpa to manage
packages.  The functions to do this come from the emacs-prelude
package, and I need to add a few packages.  Another thing to do would
be to migrate packages from elpa to el-get, which seems to have much
fresher content.

Note that this only works with emacs 24.
