Package Manager

Sort out what, exactly, is the difference between elpa and el-get.  it
seems that el-get is the much better choice.  so why elpa?

should i just transfer everything?  perhaps elpa offers better
stability, but it seems to have some bleeding edge builds, while
others are simply out of date.  this is the same basic problem i had
with fink -- indeed, with *any* package manager.
