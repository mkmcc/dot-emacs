Deft Notes

i really have no idea what i'm doing here, but here's a list of things
to try:
1. read the manual ?
2. experiment
3. this requires making a few files.

actually, this is pretty slick.  f5 to open up deft, and type the name
of a title to narrow down choices.  then enter to select a file.
type, save.  C-c C-c to clear the search.

according to the website: Common file operations can also be carried
out from within Deft. Files can be renamed using C-c C-r or deleted
using C-c C-d. New files can also be created using C-c C-n for quick
creation or C-c C-m for a filename prompt. You can leave Deft at any
time with C-c C-q.
